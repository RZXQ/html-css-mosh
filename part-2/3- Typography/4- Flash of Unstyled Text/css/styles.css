| auto         | Browser default: usually "block" (invisible up to 3s), may act like "swap" in some browsers   | Up to 3s               | Fallback font after up to 3s, text swaps to custom font only if font loads (after 3 days, font finally appears)                           |
| block        | Text invisible for up to 3s, then fallback font, swaps to custom font only when loaded         | Up to 3s               | Fallback font after 3s, swaps to custom font after 3 days (when the font finally loads)                                                   |
| swap         | Fallback font is shown instantly, swaps to custom font as soon as it loads                     | 0s                     | Fallback font is visible until font loads (3 days), then swaps to custom font                                                             |
| fallback     | Text invisible for about 100ms, then fallback font is used. Swaps to custom font only if very fast | ~100ms                 | Fallback font is shown almost instantly, but swap to custom font only happens if the font loads quickly (not in 3 days)                   |
| optional     | Like "fallback", but browser tries to use custom font only if it can be loaded quickly or from cache. On first slow load, only fallback; on subsequent visits, custom font may show immediately if cached. | ~100ms                 | First slow load: fallback font only, custom font is not shown.<br>Second load (if font is cached): custom font can appear immediately if available in cache.               |

- For "optional", if the font is already cached from a previous (faster) visit, it will display instantly, but on a very slow first load the fallback is used and custom font is skipped entirely.
- For "fallback", the behavior on repeat loads remains the same: fallback font is used unless the custom font loads quickly.
- For "auto", "block" and "swap", the custom font will eventually replace the fallback/invisible text, but only after the font has fully loaded (3 days in this example).
