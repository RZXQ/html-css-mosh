/*         What is Device Pixel Ratio (DPR)?        */
/* ================================================ */
/*
1. Physical Resolution (Real Pixels):
   - The actual number of tiny dots (pixels) that make up the screen.
   - Example: iPhone 4 has 960 pixels tall × 640 pixels wide.

2. Logical Resolution (CSS Pixels):
   - The size the website thinks the screen is—this is what you use in CSS and layouts.
   - Makes designing sites much easier.
   - Example: On iPhone 4, the logical resolution is 480 × 320 pixels.

3. Device Pixel Ratio (DPR):
   - This tells you how many real pixels fit into one CSS pixel.
   - Formula: DPR = Physical Pixels / Logical Pixels
   - Example: 960 / 480 = 2 (So, 2 real pixels are used for every CSS pixel)

4. How Images Work with DPR (`srcset`):
   - To look sharp on all screens, you need to give the browser different sizes of the same image.
   - If your image space is 400px wide (in CSS):
     - @1x → Use a 400px wide image for regular screens (DPR=1)
     - @2x → Use an 800px wide image for high-res screens (DPR=2)
     - @3x → Use a 1200px wide image for super sharp screens (DPR=3)
   - The browser picks the best image size for each screen automatically.

5. Why provide different image sizes?
   - If you only supply a 400px image, it will look blurry on @2x and @3x screens.
   - By giving 400px, 800px, and 1200px versions, every device gets an image that matches its screen’s sharpness.

**Result:**
   - All devices will show a sharp, non-blurry image.
   - The image will look the same quality (crisp and clear) on every screen.

**Tip:**
   - Always offer images for 1x, 2x, and 3x screens using the `srcset` attribute.
   - This gives everyone the best experience—no blurry images!
