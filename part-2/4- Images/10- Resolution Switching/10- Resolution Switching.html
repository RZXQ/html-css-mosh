Explanation of srcset and sizes attributes:

srcset Attribute:
-----------------
- Provides a list of image files along with their intrinsic widths.
- Format: "URL widthDescriptor", where the widthDescriptor (e.g., "400w") indicates the
intrinsic width of that image in pixels.
- In this example:
  images/meal@1x.jpg  400w  -> The image is 400 pixels wide.
  images/meal@2x.jpg  800w  -> The image is 800 pixels wide.
  images/meal@3x.jpg 1200w  -> The image is 1200 pixels wide.
- How Selection Works:
  • The browser calculates the display width of the image using the sizes attribute.
  • For example, if the computed display width is 400 pixels, the browser looks for an image
    in srcset that is around 400 pixels wide. On a standard device (1x pixel density), it would
    choose the 400w image.
  • If the device has a higher pixel density (like a Retina display), even if the display width
    is 400 pixels, the browser might select a higher resolution image (e.g., 800w) to ensure the image
    appears sharp.

sizes Attribute:
----------------
- Describes the expected display width of the image in the layout for different viewport sizes.
- It helps the browser calculate the actual width in CSS pixels that the image will occupy.
- Units used:
  * "vw" (viewport width): 1vw equals 1% of the viewport's width.
    - 100vw: 100% of the viewport width.
    - 50vw: 50% of the viewport width.
    - 33vw: Approximately 33% of the viewport width.
- In this example, the sizes attribute is defined as:
  (max-width:600px) 100vw,
  (max-width:700px) 50vw,
  33vw
  This means:
    • For viewport widths of 600px or less, the image will display at 100% of the viewport width.
    • For viewport widths between 601px and 700px, the image will display at 50% of the viewport width.
    • For viewport widths greater than 700px, the image will display at 33% of the viewport width.

How It All Works Together:
----------------------------
- The browser first uses the sizes attribute to determine how many CSS pixels wide the image will
be displayed. For instance, on a device with a 600px wide viewport, if the condition (max-width:600px)
applies, the image will be rendered at 600px wide (100vw).
- Next, the browser examines the srcset list to select an image whose intrinsic width best matches the
calculated display width, taking into account the device's pixel density.
  • For a calculated display width of 400px on a standard screen, the 400w image is the best match.
  • On a high-resolution display, even with a 400px display width, a higher resolution image like the 800w
    version may be chosen to ensure visual clarity.
