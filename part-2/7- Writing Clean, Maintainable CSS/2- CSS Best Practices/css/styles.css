Best Practices for Writing Maintainable CSS:

1. Follow a Consistent Naming Convention:
   - Pick one style and use it consistently across your project.
   - Examples:
     - Kebab-case: .nav-bar
     - CamelCase: .navBar
     - PascalCase: .NavBar
     - Underscore: .nav_bar

2. Create Logical Sections in Your Stylesheets:
   - Use comments to divide your CSS into meaningful parts.
   - Examples:
     - // Basic Styles
     - // Typography
     - // Forms
     - // Navigation Bar

3. Avoid Over-Specific Selectors:
   - Keep selectors simple to improve maintainability.
   - Example to avoid: div.nav > ul.items > li {}
   - Reason: Deeply nested selectors are harder to manage.

4. Avoid the !important Keyword:
   - Use specificity and cascading rules instead whenever possible.

5. Sort CSS Properties:
   - Arrange properties in a logical order for better readability.

6. Take Advantage of Style Inheritance:
   - Reuse styles from parent elements where applicable.
   - Example: font-family: inherit;

7. Extract Repetitive Patterns:
   - Identify and consolidate repeated styles into reusable classes.

8. Avoid Repetitive Values:
   - Keep your CSS concise by minimizing redundant values.
